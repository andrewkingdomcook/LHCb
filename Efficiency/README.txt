Overview:

Programs to calculate the efficiency of parts of the detector and selection processes (i.e. in selecting a particle, how many other particles do we lose due to that process?).

Calculated both from data collected by the LHCb detector, and also Monte Carlo simulation.



Basic structure:

- Calculates the number of particles before and after a certain process.
- Provides efficiency as a function of various variables (e.g. transverse momentum)
